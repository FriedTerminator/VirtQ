# VirtQ
Currently developing a secure, interactive Q&A platform with a strong focus on responsive UI and scalable backend design. The front-end is being built with React and Redux, while the back-end is structured using Spring Boot, with plans to explore transitioning portions to Python and FastAPI. I'm integrating MySQL for structured data storage and designing RESTful APIs to handle session workflows and question management. Additionally, I’m prototyping AI-powered features for moderation and summarization. This project emulates a startup-style development cycle — working independently, iterating quickly, and prioritizing clean code and deployment-readiness. I’m also actively exploring tools like Docker, Tailwind CSS, and PostgreSQL to expand the project stack.
Tools: Spring Boot, React, Redux, MySQL, AI
